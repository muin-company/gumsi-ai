👋 Hi Product Hunt! I'm MJ, co-founder of GumsiAI.

**Why we built this:**

I passed the Korean GED (검정고시) myself 3 years ago. It was lonely, expensive, and intimidating. Private tutors cost $50-100/hour. Study cafes felt isolating. Online resources were scattered and low-quality.

When GPT-4 launched, I realized AI could be the tutor every GED student deserves: patient, available 24/7, and completely free.

**What GumsiAI does:**

- 🤖 **AI Tutor:** Ask questions in Korean, get instant, detailed explanations
- 📚 **Personalized Plans:** AI creates study schedules based on your exam date and weak points
- 📊 **Progress Tracking:** See exactly where you need to improve
- 💯 **Practice Problems:** Thousands of questions with step-by-step solutions
- ❤️ **Always Free:** No paywalls, no limits, no ads

**Who it's for:**

The 50,000+ Korean students who take the GED every year. Many are:
- High school dropouts seeking a second chance
- Working adults completing their education
- Young people who couldn't afford regular schooling

**What we're asking:**

We're in beta with 30 students. We'd love your feedback:
- What questions do you have about AI tutoring?
- If you're outside Korea, would you use this for other standardized tests?
- What features would make this more useful?

Try it free at **gumsi.ai** 🚀

### FAQ Preparation

**Why prepare FAQ?**
- Answer common questions before they're asked
- Reduce friction in comments
- Show you've thought through objections

**Common questions to expect:**

**Q: Is this really free?**
A: Yes! 100% free, no paywalls, no credit card required. We believe every student deserves access to quality tutoring regardless of their financial situation. We're exploring sustainable monetization (enterprise licenses for schools) but the core product will always be free for students.

**Q: How does the AI tutor work?**
A: We use GPT-4 fine-tuned on Korean GED curriculum. The AI can explain concepts, solve practice problems step-by-step, and adapt to your learning pace. It's like having a patient, knowledgeable tutor available 24/7.

**Q: Do you have data on student outcomes?**
A: We're in early beta with 30 students. Preliminary data shows 85% find the AI explanations helpful, and average study time increased by 3 hours/week. We're tracking pass rates for the April 2026 GED exam.

**Q: Is this only for Korean students?**
A: Currently yes - the curriculum is specific to Korea's GED (검정고시). However, the underlying technology works for any standardized test. We're exploring expansion to SAT, GRE, and international equivalents based on demand.

**Q: What subjects do you cover?**
A: All 6 Korean GED subjects: Korean, Math, English, Social Studies, Science, and electives. The AI can tutor any topic within these subjects.

**Q: How do you ensure answer accuracy?**
A: We validate AI responses against official GED answer keys. When the AI is uncertain, it explicitly says so and suggests consulting official materials. We also have a feedback loop where students can flag incorrect answers.

**Q: What's your business model?**
A: Current plan: Free for students forever. Potential revenue from:
1. Enterprise licenses (schools, tutoring centers)
2. API access for developers
3. Premium analytics for parents/teachers
All monetization will be B2B/B2G, never charging students.

**Q: Why Product Hunt? Isn't your audience in Korea?**
A: Great question! We're here to:
1. Get feedback from the global EdTech community
2. Explore international expansion opportunities
3. Connect with potential partners/investors
4. Share our story with builders who care about social impact

**Q: Can I use this outside Korea?**
A: The current product is Korea-specific, but we'd love to hear if you'd use a similar AI tutor for other standardized tests! That feedback will shape our roadmap.

**Q: Is there a mobile app?**
A: Not yet - we're web-first (mobile-responsive). Native iOS/Android apps are on the roadmap for Q2 2026 if we see strong adoption.

**Q: How do you handle privacy/data?**
A: We comply with Korean privacy laws (PIPA). Student data is encrypted, never sold, and used only to improve tutoring quality. Students can delete their account anytime.

### Engagement Tactics

#### Comment Response Strategy

**Speed:**
- Respond to every comment within 30 minutes (during active phases)
- Use saved replies for common questions (but personalize each)

**Tone:**
- Grateful, humble, authentic
- Not salesy - focus on learning and community
- Acknowledge criticism constructively

**Example responses:**

**To positive comment:**
> Thanks so much, [Name]! Your point about [specific thing they mentioned] really resonates. We actually [related insight]. Would love to hear your thoughts on [follow-up question].

**To critical comment:**
> Really appreciate the honest feedback, [Name]. You're right that [acknowledge their point]. We're working on [how you're addressing it]. In the meantime, [workaround or explanation]. Keep the feedback coming!

**To question:**
> Great question! [Answer in 2-3 sentences max]. Happy to dive deeper if you're interested - feel free to DM or email support@gumsi.ai.

**To feature request:**
> Love this idea! We've actually had a few people ask about [feature]. Adding to our roadmap for [timeframe]. If you want to beta test when it's ready, drop your email here: [link].

#### Social Amplification

**Twitter/X Strategy:**

**Tweet 1 (Launch):**
```
🚀 We're live on @ProductHunt!

GumsiAI = Free AI tutor for Korean GED students

Why it matters: 50K+ students/year can't afford tutoring

**LinkedIn Strategy:**

**Post 1 (Personal - MJ):**
```
Today we're launching GumsiAI on Product Hunt.

It's a free AI tutor for Korean GED students.

I built it because 3 years ago, I was one of those students.

[Personal story - 300-500 words]

If you believe education should be accessible to everyone, I'd appreciate your support: [link]
```

**Post 2 (Company page):**
```
🚀 Launch day!

GumsiAI is now live on Product Hunt.

Our mission: Make quality education accessible to every student, regardless of financial situation.

Starting with Korean GED, expanding globally.

Check it out: [link]
```

#### Community Posting

**Reddit Guidelines:**
- Check subreddit rules first (many ban self-promotion)
- Frame as "Show Reddit: I built..." not "Check out my product"
- Be present in comments, don't just drop link and leave
- Provide value (explain technical decisions, share learnings)

**Example Reddit post (r/SideProject):**
```
Title: I built a free AI tutor for Korean GED students

Body:
Hey r/SideProject! I just launched GumsiAI on Product Hunt and wanted to share the journey.

**What it is:** AI tutor for Korean students preparing for the GED (검정고시). Think ChatGPT but specialized for GED curriculum, with study plans, progress tracking, etc.

**Why I built it:** I passed the GED 3 years ago. Private tutoring costs $50-100/hr in Korea, which many students can't afford. With GPT-4, I realized we could make quality tutoring free for everyone.

**The stack:** Next.js, GPT-4 API, Supabase, Vercel

**What I learned:**
- [Interesting technical challenge]
- [User research insight]
- [Business model consideration]

**What's next:** Currently free for students. Exploring B2B monetization (school licenses) to sustain it.

Happy to answer any questions about the build or the problem space!

## Competitive Analysis

### Why Competitive Analysis Matters

On Product Hunt, you're not just competing for users - you're competing for attention. Understanding your competition helps you:
- Differentiate your positioning
- Time your launch strategically
- Learn from others' successes/failures
- Identify untapped audiences

---

### Direct Competitors (EdTech AI)

#### 1. Duolingo Max (AI Features)
**What they do:** AI-powered language learning
**PH Performance:** N/A (pre-PH brand)
**Strengths:** Gamification, brand recognition, free tier
**Weaknesses:** Not focused on standardized tests, limited subjects
**Our differentiation:** GED-specific, Korean market, 100% AI-driven

#### 2. Khan Academy Khanmigo
**What they do:** AI tutor for K-12 subjects
**PH Performance:** Not launched on PH
**Strengths:** Trusted brand, comprehensive content, GPT-4 powered
**Weaknesses:** US-centric, paywall ($9/mo), broad vs. specialized
**Our differentiation:** Free, GED-specific, Korean focus

#### 3. Quizlet Q-Chat
**What they do:** AI tutor for flashcard-based learning
**PH Performance:** Strong brand, didn't need PH
**Strengths:** Existing user base, multi-subject
**Weaknesses:** Not exam-focused, limited to flashcard style
**Our differentiation:** Full curriculum coverage, practice problems, progress tracking

---

### Indirect Competitors (Standardized Test Prep)

#### 1. Magoosh
**Category:** GRE/GMAT/SAT prep
**Business model:** Subscription ($149-299)
**Strengths:** Video lessons, expert tutors, proven results
**Weaknesses:** Expensive, not AI-driven, not GED-focused
**Our advantage:** Free, AI, GED-specific

#### 2. PrepScholar
**Category:** SAT/ACT prep
**Business model:** Premium ($397+)
**Strengths:** Personalized study plans, score improvement guarantee
**Weaknesses:** US-only, expensive, traditional content
**Our advantage:** AI tutoring, free, Korean market

---

### Product Hunt Launches (Same Category)

**Strategy:** Monitor Product Hunt daily (D-7 to D-Day) for:
- Other EdTech launches
- AI tutor products
- Education accessibility tools

**If similar product launches same day:**
- Emphasize unique differentiators (Korean GED, free forever)
- Be first to comment on their launch (build goodwill)
- Don't bash competition - focus on our story

**Research past EdTech launches:**

#### Example: Photomath (Historical)
- **Rank:** #1 Product of the Day
- **Upvotes:** 1,200+
- **Why it worked:** Clear value prop (photo → solution), free, huge TAM
- **Lesson:** Visual demo is crucial, free tier drives engagement

#### Example: Notion AI (Feb 2023)
- **Rank:** #1 Product of the Week
- **Upvotes:** 5,000+
- **Why it worked:** Existing user base, clear use case, hype
- **Lesson:** Leverage existing community if you have one

---

### Monitoring Strategy

**Daily (D-7 to D-1):**
- [ ] Check Product Hunt upcoming launches
- [ ] Google: "AI tutor Product Hunt"
- [ ] Search Twitter: Product Hunt EdTech
- [ ] Note any direct competitors planning to launch

**Launch Day:**
- [ ] Check who else launched today (by 01:00 PST)
- [ ] Review their positioning
- [ ] Adjust our messaging if needed (emphasize unique angles)
- [ ] Engage with their launches (goodwill, not competition)

**Tool:** Use https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming to see scheduled launches

---

### Market Positioning

**How we stand out:**

| Dimension | Us | Typical Competitor |
|-----------|----|--------------------|
| **Price** | Free forever | $50-300/mo |
| **Geography** | Korea-first | US-centric |
| **Test Focus** | GED only | Multiple tests |
| **Technology** | 100% AI-driven | Human tutors + content |
| **Access** | 24/7, instant | Scheduled sessions |
| **Personalization** | Adaptive AI | Fixed curriculum |

**Our unique value prop:**
> "The only free, AI-powered tutor built specifically for Korean GED students by former GED students."

---

### Lessons from Competitors

**What works:**
- ✅ Free tier (drives signups)
- ✅ Visual demos (show don't tell)
- ✅ Social proof (testimonials, metrics)
- ✅ Clear target audience (not "for everyone")
- ✅ Founder story (authenticity matters)

**What doesn't work:**
- ❌ Vague positioning ("AI for education")
- ❌ Paywall required to try (kills PH momentum)
- ❌ No demo/screenshots (users won't imagine)
- ❌ Overhyped claims (gets called out in comments)
- ❌ Ignoring comments (tanks engagement)

**Timing:**

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue 1: Submission Rejected/Delayed

**Symptoms:**
- Product not appearing after submission
- Email from PH saying "needs review"
- Product in "pending" state for >1 hour

**Causes:**
- Account not verified
- Product looks spammy
- Duplicate submission
- Violated PH guidelines

**Solutions:**
1. Check email for PH notification
2. Verify account (email, phone if needed)
3. Review PH guidelines: https://www.producthunt.com/faq
4. Contact PH support: hello@producthunt.com
5. Resubmit with corrected information

**Prevention:**
- Verify account 1 week before launch
- Test submission with draft 2 days before
- Follow all guidelines strictly

---

#### Issue 2: Low Upvotes (<50 in first 6 hours)

**Symptoms:**
- Stuck at 20-30 upvotes by 06:00 PST
- Rank #15+
- Low comment engagement

**Diagnosis:**
- Weak tagline/description?
- Poor visual assets?
- Timing issue (too many competitors)?
- Network not activated?

**Solutions:**

**Immediate (within 2 hours):**
1. Reach out to warm network personally:
   - "Hey [Name], we launched on PH today. Would love your honest feedback!" (not just "please upvote")
   - DM 20-30 close contacts individually
   
2. Post in communities you're active in:
   - Don't spam, provide context
   - "We launched X to solve Y, would appreciate feedback"
   
3. Engage with other launches:
   - Comment thoughtfully on 5-10 other products
   - Build goodwill, some will reciprocate

**Short-term (6-12 hours):**
4. Create viral content:
   - Twitter thread with personal story
   - LinkedIn post with behind-the-scenes
   - Reddit post in relevant communities (if allowed)
   
5. Offer exclusive:
   - "First 100 PH users get [special feature]"
   - Creates urgency
   
6. A/B test social copy:
   - Different angle in afternoon posts
   - Emphasize different value prop

**Accept reality:**
- If still <100 upvotes by 18:00 PST, unlikely to hit Top 5
- Focus on quality engagement over vanity metrics
- Learn for next launch

---

#### Issue 3: Negative Comments/Trolls

**Types of negative comments:**

**Type A: Constructive criticism**
> "Looks interesting but the UI is confusing. Why isn't X more prominent?"

**Response:**
```
Thanks for the honest feedback! You're right that [specific point]. We're working on [solution]. In the meantime, [workaround]. Keep the feedback coming!
```

**Type B: Skepticism**
> "How is this different from ChatGPT? Why not just use that?"

**Response:**
```
Great question! While ChatGPT is amazing, GumsiAI is specifically:
- Trained on Korean GED curriculum (knows exam format, question types)
- Includes progress tracking and study plans
- Pre-loaded with practice problems and weakness analysis

Think of it as ChatGPT + GED tutor expertise + student dashboard.

Happy to demo if you're curious!
```

**Type C: Trolling**
> "This is garbage. AI will never replace real teachers."

**Response (if any):**
```
We're not trying to replace teachers! Our goal is to supplement education for students who can't afford private tutoring. Many of our users study alongside teachers at alternative schools.

But I hear your concern about AI in education - it's an important conversation.
```

**Or ignore if purely inflammatory.**

---

#### Issue 4: Website Crashes

**Symptoms:**
- 500 errors
- Slow load times (>5s)
- Users reporting "site down" in comments

**Immediate actions:**
1. **Check status:**
   - Visit gumsi.ai from incognito window
   - Check uptime monitor (UptimeRobot, Pingdom)
   - Review error logs (Sentry, Vercel logs)

2. **Communicate:**
   - Post on PH immediately:
     ```
     Update: We're experiencing high traffic (amazing!) and some users are seeing slow load times. Our team is scaling up servers now. Thanks for your patience! 🙏
     ```
   - Pin comment at top
   - Update every 15 minutes with progress

3. **Fix:**
   - Scale up server resources (Vercel, AWS, etc.)
   - Enable CDN if not already
   - Cache aggressively
   - Add queue system if needed

4. **Follow up:**
   - Once fixed, update PH: "We're back! Thanks for bearing with us."
   - Send apology email to users who tried to sign up: "We're live now - give us another shot!"

**Prevention:**
- Load test before launch (simulate 1,000 concurrent users)
- Have autoscaling configured
- Use CDN (Cloudflare) from day 1
- Monitor alerts set up (get notified if downtime >1 min)

---

#### Issue 5: Rank Drops Suddenly

**Symptoms:**
- Was #5, now #8
- Upvotes still coming in but rank falling

**Causes:**
- Other products getting more upvotes faster
- PH algorithm adjusting (considers engagement, not just upvotes)
- Time decay (older products drop)

**Response:**
1. **Don't panic** - rank fluctuates throughout the day
2. **Focus on engagement:**
   - More comments = higher rank
   - Encourage discussion, not just upvotes
   - Post thought-provoking update
   
3. **Final push:**
   - If late afternoon (18:00+ PST), make last call to network
   - "We're [#X], so close to [goal], last few hours to help!"
   
4. **Accept outcome:**
   - If competitors are crushing it, celebrate what you did achieve
   - #8 is still great exposure
   - Learn from top performers

---

#### Issue 6: Hunter Backs Out Last Minute

**Symptoms:**
- D-1 or D-0, hunter says they can't launch for you

**Solution:**
1. **Self-launch immediately**
   - Don't delay launch waiting for replacement hunter
   - Founder-launched products often do better (authenticity)
   
2. **Adjust messaging:**
   - Emphasize founder story even more
   - "I'm the founder, this is my first PH launch, and I'm nervous but excited!"
   
3. **Ask for support:**
   - "As a first-time launcher, I'd really appreciate your feedback and support"
   
**This is not a disaster - it's an opportunity for authentic storytelling.**

---

#### Issue 7: Competitor Launches Same Day

**Symptoms:**
- Another AI EdTech product launches Feb 14
- Similar positioning

**Response:**
1. **Don't engage in competition:**
   - No negative comments on their launch
   - No "us vs. them" framing
   
2. **Emphasize differentiation:**
   - Update your comments to highlight unique aspects (Korean GED, free forever, founder story)
   
3. **Support them:**
   - Actually comment on their launch constructively
   - Builds goodwill with PH community
   - Shows you're confident in your product
   
4. **Collaborate if possible:**
   - DM founder: "Hey, saw we launched similar products today! Want to cross-promote?"
   
**Rising tide lifts all boats - especially in niche categories like EdTech.**

#### Issue 8: Press Inquiries

**Symptoms:**
- Email from reporter: "Can we cover your launch?"

**Response process:**
1. **Verify legitimacy:**
   - Check email domain (TechCrunch = techcrunch.com)
   - Google the reporter's name
   - Beware of fake press (spam)
   
2. **Respond quickly (within 2 hours):**
   ```
   Hi [Reporter],
   
   Thanks for your interest in GumsiAI!
   
   I'd be happy to provide more information. Are you available for a quick call today, or would you prefer email Q&A?
   
   Happy to provide:
   - Demo access
   - User interviews
   - Product metrics
   - Photos/assets
   
   Best,
   MJ
   [phone]
   ```

3. **Prepare press kit:**
   - One-pager with key facts
   - High-res logo & screenshots
   - Founder photo
   - Quote-ready statements
   - User testimonials

4. **Coordinate with ONE:**
   - Major press (TechCrunch, VentureBeat) → ONE does interview
   - Minor press (blogs, podcasts) → MJ does interview
   
5. **Follow up:**
   - Ask when article will publish
   - Offer to review quotes for accuracy (not editorial control)
   - Share widely when published

---

## Appendix: Best Practices

### Product Hunt Unwritten Rules

**Do:**
- ✅ Be authentic and humble
- ✅ Respond to every comment
- ✅ Ask for feedback, not just upvotes
- ✅ Engage with other launches
- ✅ Celebrate your team publicly
- ✅ Share learnings transparently
- ✅ Thank everyone individually

**Don't:**
- ❌ Buy upvotes (instant ban)
- ❌ Ask for upvotes in exchange for product access
- ❌ Spam communities with launch link
- ❌ Ignore negative feedback
- ❌ Launch and disappear
- ❌ Bash competitors
- ❌ Fake testimonials/metrics

---

### Timing Best Practices

**Day of week:**
- **Best:** Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- **Okay:** Monday, Friday
- **Avoid:** Saturday, Sunday (lower traffic)

**Time of day:**
- Launch at 00:01 PST to maximize 24-hour window
- Peak engagement: 09:00-15:00 PST (US morning/afternoon)

**Seasonal:**
- Avoid major holidays (Dec 24-Jan 1)
- Avoid Thanksgiving week (US)
- Good: Back-to-school season (Aug-Sep) for EdTech

**For GumsiAI (Feb 14):**
- ✅ Friday - okay (Valentine's Day might reduce B2B traffic but increase B2C)
- ✅ Non-holiday in Korea
- ✅ Week before long weekends (US Presidents Day)
- ⚠️ Risk: Valentine's Day theme might dominate feed

---

### Visual Asset Best Practices

**Thumbnail:**
- Use brand colors
- Recognizable logo
- Avoid text (logo should be self-explanatory)
- Test at 48×48px (very small size)
- Transparent background (or solid color)

**Gallery images:**
- First image = hero (shows full product value)
- Subsequent images = drill into features
- Use annotations sparingly (arrows, highlights)
- Avoid text walls - show UI, not explain
- Keep consistent style (color scheme, fonts)
- Use real data (not lorem ipsum)
- Show mobile + desktop if applicable

**Demo video:**
- First 3 seconds = hook ("Watch me solve a GED problem in 30 seconds with AI")
- Show real usage, not marketing slides
- Captions (many watch without sound)
- End with CTA ("Try free at gumsi.ai")
- Upload to YouTube unlisted (easier to update than PH direct upload)

---

### Copy Best Practices

**Tagline:**
- Lead with value, not tech ("AI tutor for GED" not "GPT-4 powered EdTech")
- Include target audience ("for Korean students")
- Mention key differentiation ("free, 24/7")
- Avoid jargon
- Test readability at <60 chars (mobile preview)

**Description:**
- First sentence = who it's for + what problem it solves
- Second sentence = how it works
- Third sentence = why you built it or key differentiation
- Use simple language (8th grade reading level)
- Avoid marketing fluff ("revolutionary, game-changing")

**First comment:**
- Personal story (founder journey)
- Problem → Solution → Ask
- Include question for community ("What features would you add?")
- Keep under 300 words
- End with clear CTA ("Try at gumsi.ai")

---

### Engagement Best Practices

**Responding to comments:**
- Speed matters (within 30 min during active hours)
- Personalize each response (mention their name, specific point)
- Ask follow-up questions (keep conversation going)
- Don't be defensive about criticism
- Use emoji sparingly (tone indicator, not spam)

**Asking for upvotes:**
- ❌ "Please upvote us!"
- ✅ "We'd love your feedback and support"
- ❌ "Upvote to unlock feature X"
- ✅ "Check it out and let us know what you think"

**Social amplification:**
- Post multiple times (morning, midday, evening) with different angles
- Tag relevant people (but not excessively)
- Use platform-specific formats (Twitter thread ≠ LinkedIn post)
- Include visuals (screenshots, GIFs)
- Make it easy to share (clear CTA, short link)

---

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Launching too early**
- Product has critical bugs
- No demo/screenshots ready
- Website not ready for traffic

**Solution:** Launch when it's "good enough" - you'll iterate post-launch

**Mistake 2: Set and forget**
- Submit at 00:01 PST, go to sleep
- Don't respond to comments for hours

**Solution:** Dedicate entire day to engagement

**Mistake 3: Only asking warm network**
- Only email friends/family
- Don't engage with broader community

**Solution:** 50% warm network + 50% organic/community

**Mistake 4: Ignoring negative feedback**
- Delete or don't respond to criticism
- Get defensive in comments

**Solution:** Respond professionally, thank for feedback, explain or commit to fixing

**Mistake 5: Overhyping**
- "This will revolutionize education!"
- Fake metrics or testimonials

**Solution:** Be honest about what you've built, where you are, what's next

**Mistake 6: No clear CTA**
- "Check us out"
- No link in first comment

**Solution:** Every post should have clear, specific CTA ("Try free at gumsi.ai")

**Result:** #42, 35 upvotes  

**What went wrong:**

- Engage all day
- Free tier essential

---

#### Failure Case 2: Over-Hyped Launch

**What went wrong:**
- Overhyped claims ("10x better than X")

- Match or exceed visual quality

---

#### Failure Case 4: Poor Timing

**Launch:** Dec 26, 2020  
**Result:** #20, 50 upvotes  

**What went wrong:**

**Lesson for GumsiAI:**

- Full team availability required
- Don't launch during holidays/weekends

---

## Closing Thoughts

**This launch is not about winning Product Hunt.**

It's about:
- Sharing GumsiAI with the world
- Getting feedback from people who care about education
- Connecting with other builders
- Validating our mission: making education accessible

**Whatever happens on Feb 14:**
- Top 5 or #50, we'll learn
- 200 upvotes or 20, we'll grow
- Viral or quiet, we'll keep building

**The real success** is that a student who couldn't afford tutoring will now have a free AI tutor. That's worth celebrating regardless of where we rank.

**Let's do this.** 🚀
